Tarot has a rich history, largely due to its popularity as a divination tool. A standard deck generally consists of 78 cards, each individual one portraying its own unique symbolism! ✨

Many people utilize tarot readings to gain insight into life events and guidance to overcome obstacles. For this application, we will be using images taken from the famous Rider-Waite designs.
